## Table of Contents
Our dSSM layer can be easily used into existed frameworks, like eSSM ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396), [github](https://github.com/leonty1/essm/tree/main)), S4 work ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396), [guthub](https://github.com/state-spaces/s4)). Thanks!

### Data
We follow all datasets setup as introduced in eSSM and S4.
